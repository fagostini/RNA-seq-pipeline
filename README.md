## RNA-seq processing pipeline

This repository contains a pipeline for the analysis of RNA-seq (and derived variants) data. 

__Motivation__

The aim was to create a standard RNA-seq pipeline that included quality controls, alignment and post-processing.
The pipeline has been developed using [Snakemake](http://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), a tool to create reproducible and scalable data analyses.

It was used by Federico for his `intergenic transcription` project, and then generalised to become a tool than could be applied to any set of RNA-seq experiments.

__Requirements__

* [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) >= 3.6 (`os`, `platform`, `pandas`, `numpy`, `pyBigWig`, `string`, `regex` and `itertools` modules)
* [Snakemake](http://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
* [_FastQC_](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/)
* [_Trim Galore!_](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/trim_galore/) (and its dependency [_Cutadapt_](https://cutadapt.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)) 
* [_Bowtie2_](http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/bowtie2/index.shtml)
* [_STAR_](https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR)

Optional:
* [_StringTie_](https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/stringtie) (required for transcriptome assembly)
* [_UMI-tools_]((https://github.com/CGATOxford/UMI-tools)) (required for deduplication using UMIs)
* [_deepTools_](https://deeptools.readthedocs.io) (required for generation of bigWig tracks)

## Setup and usage

IMPORTANT: Before running the pipeline modify the `config.yaml` according to your needs, or create a new one. In case you do not need a splice-aware alignment, remember to specify either `NETseq` or `GROseq` as `seq_type` parameter.

__Barcodes and UMIs__

**NEW:** You can now specify the `barcode` parameter in the `config.yaml` (python modules required: `regex` and `umi_tools`). This enables a routine that pre-processes the reads to extract the barcode and/or UMI sequences and carries them over up to the PCR duplicates removal performed by UMI-tools. Please note that, in order to keep this information after the mapping step, the read names are modified and some parts might get lost, though this does not apply to the paired-end mate identifiers. Moreover, barcode and UMI sequences are stored in the alignment file within the BC and RX tags, respectively. Although the RX tag is currently set to be used during the PCR duplicates removal, the BC tag is not.

__Run the pipeline__

You can run the standard workflow (mapping and quantification) using:

```
snakemake --configfile=<your config file>
```

or you can run the longer version (with trancks and transcriptome assembly) with:

```
snakemake --configfile=<your config file> -R all
```

### Pipeline breakdown

#### Overview

* Quality control on the raw data (FastQC)
* Trimming of the adapter sequence (Trim Galore!)
* Removal of ribosomal and transfer RNAs contaminations (Bowtie2)
* Alignment to the genome (STAR)
* Generation of coverage tracks (Custom scripts and ENCODE binaries)
* Removal of PCR duplicates (Picard/UMI-tools)
* Calculation of gene counts (QoRTs)
* Transcriptome assembly (StringTie)

#### Steps description

##### [FastQC](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/)

FastQC aims to provide a simple way to do some quality control checks on raw sequence data coming from high throughput sequencing pipelines. It provides a modular set of analyses which you can use to give a quick impression of whether your data has any problems of which you should be aware before doing any further analysis.

##### [Trim Galore!](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/trim_galore/)

Trim Galore! is a wrapper script to automate quality and adapter trimming as well as quality control, with some added functionality to remove biased methylation positions for RRBS sequence files (for directional, non-directional (or paired-end) sequencing).

##### [Bowtie2](http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/bowtie2/index.shtml)

Bowtie 2 is an ultrafast and memory-efficient tool for aligning sequencing reads to long reference sequences.

##### [STAR](https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR)

Basic STAR workflow consists of 2 steps:
* Generating genome indexes files.
In this step user supplied the reference genome sequences (FASTA files) and annotations (GTF file), from which STAR generate genome indexes that are utilized in the 2nd (mapping) step. 
* Mapping reads to the genome.
In this step user supplies the genome files generated in the 1st step, as well as the RNA-seq reads (sequences) in the form of FASTA or FASTQ files. STAR maps the reads to the genome,
and writes several output files, such as alignments (SAM/BAM), mapping summary statistics, splice junctions, unmapped reads, signal (wiggle) tracks etc.

_NB: The pipeline runs a script that uses the gene counts generated by STAR to assign the proper library strand (i.e., FistStrand, SecondStrand or Unstranded) to each sample. Please be aware that, if your RNA-seq targets non-canonical transcripts (e.g., up- or down-stream regions of annotated genes), the calculation of stranded genome coverage and transcriptome assembly might get affected._

##### [Picard](https://github.com/broadinstitute/picard) or [UMI-tools](https://github.com/CGATOxford/UMI-tools)

_Picard_: The MarkDuplicates tool works by comparing sequences in the 5 prime positions of both reads and read-pairs in a SAM/BAM file. After duplicate reads are collected, the tool differentiates the primary and duplicate reads using an algorithm that ranks reads by the sums of their base-quality scores (default method). MarkDuplicates also produces a metrics file indicating the numbers of duplicates for both single- and paired-end reads.

_UMI-tools_: This is the default option when read barcodes and/or UMIs are to be evaluated. The following criteria are applied to select the read that will be retained from a group of duplicated reads: i) the read with the lowest number of mapping coordinates and ii) the read with the highest mapping quality. Note that this is not the read sequencing quality and that if two reads have the same mapping quality then one will be picked at random regardless of the read quality. Otherwise a read is chosen at random.

##### [QoRTs](https://github.com/hartleys/QoRTs)

The QoRTs software package is a fast, efficient, and portable multifunction toolkit designed to assist in the analysis, quality control, and data management of RNA-Seq and DNA-Seq datasets. Its primary function is to aid in the detection and identification of errors, biases, and artifacts produced by high-throughput sequencing technology. In addition, it can produce count data designed for use with RNA-Seq differential gene expression and differential exon usage tools.

##### [StringTie](https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/stringtie)

StringTie is a fast and highly efficient assembler of RNA-Seq alignments into potential transcripts. It uses a novel network flow algorithm as well as an optional de novo assembly step to assemble and quantitate full-length transcripts representing multiple splice variants for each gene locus.

_NB: Presently, the algorithm performs the assembly only on samples that contain some keywords (i.e., WildType or WT, Untreated, siLuc and Senescence)._
